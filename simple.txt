1. Created Git Repo.
	a) Ran into issues here because I didn't copy and paste the code directly from github, even though it seemed like I had typed it correctly... in the future just copy and paste to make absolutely sure, don't type URLs. But if you have to, you can use: git remote set-url origin (url).
2. Made local repository, files, etc.
3. Tried to commit
	a) Remember, you first have to stage things, with ADD, you can't commit if you don't have anything in the staging area.
4. Staged, then committed, tried to push,  ran into said URL errors, fixed that.
	a) git push -u origin master	
5. Finished! : ).
